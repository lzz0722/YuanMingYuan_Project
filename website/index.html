            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            
            <p>This project focuses on documenting the cultural heritage destruction and artifact dispersal of Yuanmingyuan (Old Summer Palace) during the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion of 1900-1901. Using LODLAM (Linked Open Data in Libraries, Archives and Museums) methodologies, we create structured data and digital representations of ten selected cultural heritage items related to this historical event, examining their current locations, provenance, and historical significance.</p>

            <h3>Historical Background</h3>
            <p>Yuanmingyuan, known as the "Garden of Gardens," was one of the most magnificent imperial garden complexes in Chinese history. Built over more than a century during the Qing Dynasty, it covered over 3.5 square kilometers and housed countless treasures including rare books, paintings, porcelain, bronze artifacts, and architectural marvels that combined Chinese and Western artistic traditions.</p>

            <p>The palace complex had already suffered significant damage during the Second Opium War in 1860 when British and French forces looted and burned much of the site. However, the events of 1900 during the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion marked another devastating chapter in its destruction. The alliance forces, comprising troops from Britain, France, Germany, Russia, the United States, Japan, Italy, and Austria-Hungary, occupied Beijing following the Boxer Rebellion. During this period, systematic looting continued, and many remaining artifacts were removed from Yuanmingyuan and surrounding imperial collections.</p>

            <p>The 1900 invasion resulted in the further dispersal of Chinese cultural heritage across multiple nations. Unlike the earlier destruction, this period saw more organized removal of artifacts, with objects eventually finding their way into museums, private collections, and auction houses worldwide. The scale of this cultural dispersal continues to impact discussions about cultural heritage, repatriation, and the legacy of colonial collecting practices.</p>

            <h3>Project Focus and Methodology</h3>
            <p>Our research concentrates on ten specific items that document and relate to Yuanmingyuan (Old Summer Palace) during two critical periods of cultural heritage disruption: the Second Opium War (1856-1860) and the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion (1900-1901). These items encompass a diverse range of materials including looted artifacts, historical photographs, archival documents, and treaties that collectively illustrate the scope of destruction, cultural dispersal, and historical documentation of this period.
            <p>The selected items serve multiple documentary functions: some are cultural artifacts that were removed from imperial collections during the conflicts; others are photographic records that capture the physical state of Yuanmingyuan and related sites during and after these events; and still others are historical documents, such as the Boxer Protocol, that formalized the political and economic consequences of these conflicts.
            <p>The project employs digital humanities methods to create structured metadata for each item, trace their provenance where possible, and analyze the institutions that currently hold them. We utilize standard metadata schemas including Dublin Core, SPECTRUM, CCO, MODS, and TEI encoding to ensure interoperability with existing cultural heritage databases.</p>
            <p>Through this focused approach, we aim to demonstrate how digital technologies can be used to document and analyze episodes of cultural heritage destruction, while creating accessible resources for education and research about this important period in Chinese and world history.</p>
