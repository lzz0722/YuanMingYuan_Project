        <div class="content">
<div class="section">
<h2 class="section-title">Section 1</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Since the <span class="date" title="1900-05">5th moon (end of May)</span> the <span class="org" title="Organization ID: boxers">Boxers</span> have created trouble in the capital and have begun hostilities against friendly countries. <span class="person" title="Person ID: yi_kuang">Yi-K'ung</span> and <span class="person" title="Person ID: li_hongzhang">Li Hung-chang</span> are negotiating for peace at <span class="place" title="Place ID: beijing">Peking</span> with Representatives of the Powers, and a whole preliminary arrangement has already been signed.</p>
<p class="paragraph">(If) We consider the commencement of these events, (we find that they are due) to several stupid, mad, utterly ignorant, turbulent Princes and Ministers who have trampled the laws under foot. They had most absolute confidence in pernicious methods and have involved the Court. Not only did they refuse to obey Our orders to exterminate the <span class="org" title="Organization ID: boxers">Boxers</span>, but they have gone so far as to believe in them, and, stupidly, they began to attack (the Legations). So it was that this evil fire spread abroad, and circumstances did not permit of its being stopped, tens of millions of evil-doers having assembled under the elbow and the armpit (that is to say, at a most important point). Furthermore, the leaders forced generals and ignorant soldiers to attack the Legations, and so it befell that inconceivable evils persisted for several months.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The tutelary deities of the Empire have been in danger, the Imperial tombs and the temples of the Ancestors have trembled, the country has been devastated, the inhabitants are plunged in misery. No words can express the dangers to which We and H. M. the <span class="person" title="Person ID: cixi">Empress Dowager</span> have been exposed. Our heart and our head are still in pain; our tears and our resentment are confounded. It is to you, Princes and Ministers, who, by believing in evil words and allowing evil-doers free hand, have put in danger in Heaven our Ancestors and our gods, and who here below have caused the people to endure these calamities. Do you ask what is the chastisement you deserve?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="section-title">Punishments Decreed</h2>
<p class="paragraph">We have already issued two decrees. But, considering that such light punishments for such grievous faults could not be sufficient to make you expiate your crimes, We must impose upon you new and more severe punishments according to your degree of guilt.</p>
<div class="punishment-box">
<div class="punishment-number">Punishment 1</div>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="person" title="Person ID: tsai_hsun">Tsai-hsün, Prince Chuang</span>, already degraded, allowed the <span class="org" title="Organization ID: boxers">Boxers</span> to attack the Legations. He, on his own authority, published proclamations contrary to the treaties; he lightly believed the statements of evil-doers; he unlawfully caused to be decapitated a great number of persons; he has shown himself, of a truth, vulgar and stupid. We invite him, as a favor, to commit suicide. We direct <span class="person" title="Person ID: ko_pao_hua">Ko-pao-hua</span>, acting president of the Court of Censors, to go and see (that the suicide has taken place).</p>
</div>
<div class="punishment-box">
<div class="punishment-number">Punishment 2</div>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="person" title="Person ID: tsai_i">Tsai-i, Prince Tuan</span>, already degraded, led away with him several Princes and Peilo (Princes of the 3d class). He lightly gave heed to the <span class="org" title="Organization ID: boxers">Boxers</span> and foolishly advised fighting. So all these troubles broke out; his faults, of a truth, can not be ignored. <span class="person" title="Person ID: tsai_lan">Tsai-lan, Duke Fu-Kuo</span>, reduced in rank, in concert with <span class="person" title="Person ID: tsai_hsun">Tsai-Hsün</span>, foolishly published proclamations contrary to the treaties. He should also be punished for his faults. We deprive them of their nobiliary titles, but, considering that they belong to our family, We order, by special act of grace, that they be sent to <span class="place" title="Place ID: xinjiang">Hsin-chiang (Ili)</span> where they shall be condemned to prison for life. Deputies will first be sent to watch them.</p>
</div>
<div class="punishment-box">
<div class="punishment-number">Punishment 3</div>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="person" title="Person ID: yu_xian">Yü-hsien</span>, degraded governor, foolishly believed, when formerly discharging the duties of governor in <span class="place" title="Place ID: shandong">Shantung</span>, in the sorcery of the <span class="org" title="Organization ID: boxers">Boxers</span>. Arriving in <span class="place" title="Place ID: beijing">Peking</span>, he extolled them so highly that several Princes and Ministers fell under his evil influence. Being governor of <span class="place" title="Place ID: shanxi">Shansi</span>, he massacred a great number of missionaries and Christians. He is worse than an imbecile, than a madman, than a murderer; he is the chief culprit and the author of all these calamities. He has already been sent to <span class="place" title="Place ID: xinjiang">Hsin-chiang</span>, and, believing that he has arrived in <span class="place" title="Place ID: gansu">Kan-su</span>, We order that, on the receipt of the order which We send, he shall at once be beheaded. We direct the Provincial Judge <span class="person" title="Person ID: ho_fu_kun">Ho Fu-kun</span> to see that the penalty is carried out.</p>
</div>
<div class="punishment-box">
<div class="punishment-number">Punishment 4</div>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="person" title="Person ID: kang_yi">Kang-yi</span>, Assistant Grand Secretary of State, President of the Board of Works, having lent his aid to the <span class="org" title="Organization ID: boxers">Boxers</span>, serious disturbances broke out. He aided in publishing proclamations contrary to the treaties. A severe punishment was to have been inflicted on him at first, but he has died of disease. We order that the honors which he previously held shall be withdrawn from him and that he be at once degraded.</p>
</div>
<div class="punishment-box">
<div class="punishment-number">Punishment 5</div>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="person" title="Person ID: dong_fuxiang">Tung Fu-hsiang</span>, general in <span class="place" title="Place ID: gansu">Kan-su</span>, degraded but retained in office, entered (<span class="place" title="Place ID: beijing">Peking</span>) to defend (the city) with the troops under his orders; he was unable to maintain strict discipline. Ignorant, furthermore, of international questions, he followed his ideas and acted in an imprudent manner. Although the attacks on the Legations were ordered by the above degraded Princes, it is nevertheless difficult to absolve him of all faults. We intended in the first instance to have punished him severely, but, considering the signal services he has rendered in <span class="place" title="Place ID: gansu">Kan-su</span> and the sympathy felt for him by Mussulmans and Chinese, as an act of extraordinary grace We order that he shall be immediately degraded.</p>
</div>
<div class="punishment-box">
<div class="punishment-number">Punishment 6</div>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="person" title="Person ID: ying_nien">Ying-nien</span>, President of the Court of Censors, reduced in rank and displaced, opposed <span class="person" title="Person ID: tsai_hsun">Tsai-Hün</span> in publishing on his own authority proclamations contrary to the treaties. We may make due allowance for this circumstance, but as he was not able to overcome (this resistance) by force, it is, after all, difficult to absolve him. We order, as a mark of great benevolence, that he be degraded. We condemn him to death, and he shall wait in prison for his case to be passed on.</p>
</div>
<div class="punishment-box">
<div class="punishment-number">Punishment 7</div>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="person" title="Person ID: zhao_shujiao">Chao Shu-chiao</span>, President of the Board of Punishments, degraded and retained in office, had never shown till then any unfriendly feeling in relations with the Foreign Powers. Having made a report on the <span class="org" title="Organization ID: boxers">Boxers</span>, he said nothing in their favor, but through his negligence faults were made. We order, as a special act of grace, that he be degraded. We condemn him to death, and he will await in prison judgment on his case.</p>
<p class="paragraph">We command that <span class="person" title="Person ID: ying_nien">Ying-nien</span> and <span class="person" title="Person ID: zhao_shujiao">Chao Shu-chiao</span> be in the first place confined in the prison of the capital of <span class="place" title="Place ID: shaanxi">Shensi</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="punishment-box">
<div class="punishment-number">Punishment 8</div>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="person" title="Person ID: xu_tong">Hsu Tung</span>, Grand Secretary of State, and <span class="person" title="Person ID: li_bingheng">Li Ping-heng</span>, former Governor-General of <span class="place" title="Place ID: sichuan">Sze-chuan</span>, reduced in rank and displaced, died for their country, but everyone knows their faults. We order that they be degraded, and We deprive them of the posthumous honors which We had conferred on them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="conclusion">
<p class="paragraph">After the promulgation of this decree all our friendly nations should recognize that the events caused by the <span class="org" title="Organization ID: boxers">Boxers</span> are in truth only attributable to the principal authors of trouble and in no wise to the wishes of the Court.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Since We, the Emperor, not without reason do punish several of the principal authors of disorder, the mandarins and the people of the Empire will understand at once that the consequences of such affairs are of the most grave.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Respect this!</p>
